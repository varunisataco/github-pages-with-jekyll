# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the New England Patriots. 
The New England Patriots are the best team in NFL history. 
They have six super bowl vitories in the last 18 years. 
Tom Brady is the greatest player in NFL history, he has 6 rings and 3 MVP awards, 4 Super Bowl MVP's. 
Bill Belicheck is the greatest head coach in NFL history, he has the 3 most regular season wins, the most playoff and Super Bowl wins.
